# Defender's ThreatMesh Framework (DTF)

This framework helps threat hunters identify adversary pivots through domains and infrastructure, inspired by MITRE ATT&CK. It organizes techniques into tactics, providing a structured approach to uncovering related malicious activity.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Track how adversaries pivot from one domain (e.g., "com-login.com") to others.
- **Structure**: Tactics (TAXXXX) group related techniques (TXXXX).
- **Usage**: Use the [matrix](matrix.md) to explore tactics and techniques.

## Getting Started
Check the [matrix](matrix.md) for a full list of tactics and techniques with links to detailed pages.
