# T2001: Same Registrar

## Description
Adversaries register multiple domains through the same registrar to streamline operations, often using providers with lax verification.

## Example
Multiple phishing domains targeting a retailer were registered via a single obscure registrar.

## Detection
- Query WHOIS data for registrar names and cross-reference with known malicious domains.
- Monitor registrar trends in threat intelligence feeds.

## Mitigation
- Blacklist domains from high-risk registrars.
- Collaborate with registrars to suspend abusive domains.
