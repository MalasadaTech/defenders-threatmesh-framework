## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain (e.g., "secure-login.com") to others sharing the same prefix (e.g., "secure-account.com", "secure-update.com") to uncover related adversary infrastructure.

## Example
From "bank-login.com" (a known phishing domain), an analyst identifies "bank-support.com" by matching the "bank-" prefix, revealing additional phishing infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
- Query Silent Push for "bank-*" domains linked to "bank-login.com" by registration or hosting details.
- Run a Censys search for "bank-*" domains tied to the same IP range or SSL certificate as "bank-login.com".
- Use Validin to cluster "bank-*" domains associated with "bank-login.com" in threat intel feeds.

### Internal Hunt
- Search Splunk DNS logs: `index=dns "bank-*" | stats count by domain` to identify related domains.
- Query Elastic HTTP logs: `url:"bank-*" | stats count by url` to spot traffic to similar domains.
- Analyze Splunk proxy logs: `sourcetype=proxy domain="bank-*" | top domain` to detect additional "bank-" hits.
