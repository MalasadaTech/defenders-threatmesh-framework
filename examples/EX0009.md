## Description
ThreatCat.ch identifies a new KeitaroTDS domain, `deeptrickday.org`, hosted on the same IP (47.90.178.252) as other KeitaroTDS domains in the SocGholish campaign, indicating shared infrastructure. This aligns with broader KeitaroTDS activity noted in Microsoft's DEV-0569 report from 2023.
