## Description
In November 2023, analysts observed a phishing scam targeting users of Florida's "Sunpass" toll system (sunpass.com). The scam utilized domains with a "com-" prefix, such as "com-typopn.top," to mimic the legitimate site and trick users into submitting payment information. The SANS Internet Storm Center noted this as part of a surge in newly registered "com-" prefixed domains, with 10% confirmed in Phishtank as malicious.
