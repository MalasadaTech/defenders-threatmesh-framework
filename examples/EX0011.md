## Description
MalasadaTech identifies additional crypto-phishing domains by searching urlscan.io for the shared resource hash of 5f3ec643731be3a71b0845e6d398a07ea21dc3c6d0298150470b3b4a1942cf89. Additionally, MalasadaTech shows how the domain length used in a cluster of domains that were created with a domain generation algorithm could be used as a pivot. Specifically, filtering for "domain LIKE ^[a-z]{5}\.com$", in addition to other pivots, would reveal additional adversary infrastructure.
