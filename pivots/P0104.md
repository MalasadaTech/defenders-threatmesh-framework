## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same registrant details (e.g., email, name, or organization) in WHOIS data, indicating potential ownership by the same actor.

## Example
Silent Push demonstrates using the registrant email `mark_popov11@inbox.eu` to pivot from the known Lumma Stealer domain "ferromny.digital" and identify additional malicious infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same registrant email address. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
