## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious site to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding other sites that use the resources with the same name (e.g., a phishing kit that uses the same miss-spelled word like "refrence.html").

## Example
MalasadaTech shows how monitoring for the miss-spelled filename "refrence.html" can return results that use the same Copy/Paste kit.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as urlscan.io, for scan jobs by the resource name. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
