## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same name server domain (e.g., `*.ns.cloudflare.com`), often specified during registration.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that domains that use the same name server domain, in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect LandUpdate808 IOFAs.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same name server domain, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
