## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious artifact to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding artifacts that share similar embedded code, such as inline JavaScript or HTML snippets, indicating a common malicious template or script.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that the string "getIPAddres" in JavaScript code, in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as Silent Push or urlscan.io, for domains with the same unique embedded code patterns, along with other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
