## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that use the same length, along with other pivots.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows how the domain length used in a cluster of domains that were created with a domain generation algorithm could be used as a pivot. Specifically, filtering for "domain LIKE ^[a-z]{5}\.com$", in addition to other pivots, would reveal additional adversary infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, or a webscanning tool, such as urlscan.io, for domains with the same domain length. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
