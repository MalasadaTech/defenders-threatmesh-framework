## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same IP address, indicating shared hosting or infrastructure.

## Example
ThreatCat.ch identifies a new KeitaroTDS domain, `deeptrickday.org`, hosted on the same IP (47.90.178.252) as other KeitaroTDS domains in the SocGholish campaign, indicating shared infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain or IP intelligence tool, such as Silent Push or Validin, to check what other domains use the same IP. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
