## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious artifact to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding artifacts that share the same page title, indicating a common structural attribute often used in phishing or malware campaigns.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that the page title "Download", in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

MalasadaTech shows that page titles "Activitar | Template" or "Job Board", in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect SmartApeSG IOFAs.

DaveTheResearcher (@DaveLikesMalwre) shows how a campaign masquerading as AVG to deliver AnyDesk RMM can be tracked via the HTML Title "AVG 2024 | GRATIS Antivirus, VPN, TuneUp voor alle apparaten". This allows analysts to pivot and identify additional malicious infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as Silent Push or urlscan.io, for domains with the same unique structure patterns. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
