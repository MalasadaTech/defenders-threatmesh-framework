## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious artifact to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding artifacts that share the same page title, indicating a common structural attribute often used in phishing or malware campaigns.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that the page title "Download", in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

MalasadaTech shows that page titles "Activitar | Template" or "Job Board", in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect SmartApeSG IOFAs.

## Detection
