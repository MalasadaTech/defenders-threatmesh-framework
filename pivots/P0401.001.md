## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same prefix in their names, a specific form of substring similarity often used in typosquatting or brand impersonation.

## Example
MalasadaTech identifies domains very likely associated with the Lazarus APT by searching for those with the prefix "willo", such as `willo-interview.us`, `willointerview.org`, `willointerview.site`, and `willointerview.info`.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Use domain intelligence tools (e.g., Silent Push, as referenced in the example) to search for domains with a specific prefix like "willo". Cross-reference results with known malicious indicators, such as those attributed to Lazarus APT, to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
Monitor DNS logs for queries to domains with prefixes associated with known campaigns (e.g., "willo"). Set up alerts for such domains and investigate any matches for signs of phishing or malware distribution.
