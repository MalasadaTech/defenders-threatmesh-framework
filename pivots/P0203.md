## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains hosted within the same Autonomous System (AS), often indicating shared hosting infrastructure.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that ASNs 202015, or 399629, in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect SmartApeSG or LandUpdate808 and TA582 (respectively) IOFAs.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same ASN, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
- [placeholder]

## Note
The pivot can be used for both AS Name and AS Number. There is no need to specify sub-pivots for each one unless two ASNs with the same name are observed. Additionally, the AS Country is not a searchable item and no sub-pivot is needed for it.
