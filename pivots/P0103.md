## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains with similar registration dates, often indicating a coordinated campaign or bulk registration by the same actor.

## Example
Silent Push identifies Lumma actors using "metal" themed C2 domains (e.g., `ingothy.digital`, `forgeits.digital`) with closely matching creation times on March 24, 2025, indicating a coordinated campaign.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push or Validin, for domains with similar creation dates, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
