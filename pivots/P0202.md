## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by checking the IPs in proximity - that is checking the IPs directly before and after to determine if an adversary is using the subnet the IP may fall in.

## Example
Gootloadersites (AKA Gootloader - the researcher, not the threat actor) demonstrates how checking the IPs in close proximity reveal additional suspicious domains.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain or IP intelligence tool, such as Silent Push or Validin, to check what domains use the IPs in close proximity. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
