## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that use the same subsdomain.

## Example
Malasadatech demonstrates using the NS Servers and the registrar to find additional suspicious domains. Additionally, although it wasn't used, additional suspicious domains could have been found by searching for domains that have "google" as a subbdomain.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, or a webscanning tool, such as urlscan.io, for domains with the same subdomain. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
