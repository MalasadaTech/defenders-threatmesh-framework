## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that use a unique shared resource (e.g., an image, script, or file), that is hosted at the same source, indicating potential reuse of malicious assets across distinct infrastructure.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that the unique shared resource hash 5f3ec643731be3a71b0845e6d398a07ea21dc3c6d0298150470b3b4a1942cf89 can be used to reveal additional crypto-phishing sites.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as Silent Push or urlscan.io, for scan jobs with the matching unique hash. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
