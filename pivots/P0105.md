## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same top-level domain (TLD), often chosen during registration to blend in or target specific audiences.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that domains that use the same unique TLD, in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect LandUpdate808 IOFAs.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same unique TLD, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
