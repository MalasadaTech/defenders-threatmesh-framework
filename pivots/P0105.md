## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same top-level domain (TLD), often chosen during registration to blend in or target specific audiences.

## Example
From a TA582 domain like "malicious.top" (using the `.top` TLD), an analyst identifies other domains with the same TLD, such as "fake.top", revealing additional phishing infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
- Query Silent Push for domains using the `.top` TLD, filtering by recent registration dates or hosting patterns.
- Use WHOIS lookup tools to find domains with the `.top` TLD and cross-reference with threat intel.
- Leverage Validin to cluster domains by TLD, focusing on `.top`.

### Internal Hunt
- Search Splunk DNS logs for domains with the `.top` TLD: `index=dns domain="*.top" | stats count by domain`.
- Query Elastic for HTTP requests to `.top` domains: `url:"*.top" | stats count by url`.
- Analyze proxy logs in Splunk: `sourcetype=proxy domain="*.top" | top domain`.
