## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same MX records, indicating shared email infrastructure.

## Example
Silent Push identifies phishing domains by searching for MX records containing `mx*.improvmx.com`, such as `mx1.improvmx.com`, in combination with other pivots.

## Detection

### External Hunt
