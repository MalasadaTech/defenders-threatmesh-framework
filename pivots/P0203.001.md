## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same SSL certificate issuer organization, indicating potential shared infrastructure or campaign patterns.

## Example
MalasadaTech identifies SmartApeSG domains using SSL certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, enabling pivoting to other domains with the same issuer, in addition to other pivots.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push or Validin, for domains that use an SSL certificate from the same issuer, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
