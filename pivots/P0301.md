## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious artifact to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding artifacts that share similar website structure, such as HTML layout, DOM elements, or specific structural attributes, indicating a common template or design.

## Sub-Pivots
- [P0301.001: Page Title Match](P0301.001.md)
- [P0301.002: Embedded Code Similarity](P0301.002.md)

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that the page title "Download", in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

MalasadaTech shows that page titles "Activitar | Template" or "Job Board", in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect SmartApeSG IOFAs.

MalasadaTech shows that the string "getIPAddres" in JavaScript code, in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as Silent Push or urlscan.io, for domains with the same unique structure patterns. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
