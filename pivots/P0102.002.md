## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share similar substrings or patterns in their names, indicating potential typosquatting or campaign-specific naming conventions.

## Example
Silent Push uses the regex pattern `^([a-z]{1,}\-){0,1}x(\-[a-z]{1,}){0,1}\.com$` to identify phishing domains with patterns like `something-x.com` or `x-something.com`, in combination with other pivots.

MalasadaTech identifies domains very likely associated with the Lazarus APT by searching for those with the prefix "willo", such as `willo-interview.us`, `willointerview.org`, `willointerview.site`, and `willointerview.info`.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, or a webscanning tool, such as urlscan.io, for domains with the substring pattern. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
