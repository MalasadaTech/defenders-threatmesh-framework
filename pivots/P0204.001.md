## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same CNAME record, often indicating they resolve to the same canonical domain and underlying infrastructure.

## Example
MalasadaTech demonstrates (using RussianPanda's workflow) using Silent Push to perform a reverse search on the shared CNAME "ruvmq.bmtrck.com", revealing additional domains tied to the ClickFix campaign.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the DNS records such as CNAME, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
