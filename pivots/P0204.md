## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share similar DNS records, such as CNAME, or MX, which can indicate shared infrastructure or configuration patterns.

## Sub-Pivots
- [P0204.001: Shared CNAME](P0204.001.md)
- [P0204.002: Shared MX Records](P0204.002.md)

## Example
MalasadaTech demonstrates (using RussianPanda's workflow) using Silent Push to perform a reverse search on the shared CNAME "ruvmq.bmtrck.com", revealing additional domains tied to the ClickFix campaign.

Silent Push identifies phishing domains by searching for MX records containing `mx*.improvmx.com`, such as `mx1.improvmx.com`, in combination with other pivots.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for additional domains with the same DNS records such as MX or CNAME. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
