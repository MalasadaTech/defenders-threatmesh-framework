## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious site to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding other sites; analysts refine their query by specifying the HTTP response code.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows how refining the query to use the HTTP response code of 200 limits the results to only results from a scan task that scanned a site that was online.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as urlscan.io, for scan jobs that returned a specific HTTP response. Combine the pivot with additional pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
