## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same name servers, often specified during the registration process.

## Example
MalasadaTech shows that domains that use the same name server(s), in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect TA582 and SmartApeSG IOFAs.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same name server(s), in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
