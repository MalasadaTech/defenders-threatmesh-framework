## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that use the exact same resource (e.g., an identical image, script, or file), but hosted at different sources, indicating potential reuse of malicious assets across distinct infrastructure.

## Example
From the urlscan.io HTTP transactions of betterdirectit.com, an analyst can craft a query for combination of the hashes of all.min.css and logo_48.png, and search urlscan.io for those hashes to find related infrastructure.

MalasadaTech shows that the favicon hash, in combination with other pivots, can be used to reveal additional 7-Zip masquerading sites delivering malware like NetSupport RAT.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a web scanning tool, such as Silent Push or urlscan.io, for scan jobs with the matching unique hash. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.

### Internal Hunt
