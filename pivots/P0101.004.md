## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains that share the same registrant email in WHOIS data, indicating potential ownership by the same actor.

## Example
Silent Push demonstrates using the registrant email `mark_popov11@inbox.eu` to pivot from the known Lumma Stealer domain "ferromny.digital" and identify additional malicious infrastructure.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push, for domains with the same registrant email address. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
