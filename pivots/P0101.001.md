## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains registered with the same registrar.

## Examples
MalasadaTech shows that domains registered with Global Domain Group LLC, in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect LandUpdate808 IOFAs.

Malasadatech demonstrates using the NS Servers and the registrar to find additional suspicious domains. Additionally, although it wasn't used, additional suspicious domains could have been found by searching for domains that have "google" as a subbdomain.

## Detection

### External Hunt
Search a domain intelligence tool, such as Silent Push or Validin, for domains with the same registrar, in addition to other pivots. Cross-reference the results with known malicious indicators to identify potential threats.
