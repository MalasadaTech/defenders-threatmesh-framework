## Description
Analysts pivot from a known malicious domain to identify additional adversary infrastructure by finding domains hosted within the same Autonomous System (AS), often indicating shared hosting infrastructure.

## Example
From "pushcg.com" (hosted in AS399629), an analyst identifies other domains in the same AS, such as "pemalite.com", revealing additional infrastructure tied to LandUpdate808 or TA582 campaigns.

MalasadaTech shows that ASNs 202015, 29802, or 3356, in combination with other pivots, can be used to detect SmartApeSG IOFAs.

## Detection

### External Hunt
- Query Silent Push for domains hosted in AS399629, filtering by recent activity or registration patterns.
- Use BGP tools like Hurricane Electricâ€™s BGP Toolkit to find domains within AS399629.
- Leverage Validin to cluster domains by AS, focusing on AS399629.

### Internal Hunt
- Search Splunk DNS logs for domains resolved within AS399629: `index=dns | join domain [search index=bgp as="AS399629"] | stats count by domain`.
- Query Elastic for HTTP requests to domains in AS399629: `url:* AND as:"AS399629" | stats count by url`.
- Analyze proxy logs in Splunk: `sourcetype=proxy | join domain [search index=bgp as="AS399629"] | top domain`.
